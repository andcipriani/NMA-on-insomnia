Separate indirect from direct evidence (SIDE) using back-calculation method

Fixed effects model: 

          comparison k prop   nma direct indir. Diff z p-value
  suvorexant:placebo 2 1.00 -0.40  -0.40      .    . .       .
    zolpidem:placebo 1 1.00 -0.66  -0.66      .    . .       .
 suvorexant:zolpidem 0    0  0.25      .   0.25    . .       .

Random effects model: 

          comparison k prop   nma direct indir. Diff z p-value
  suvorexant:placebo 2 1.00 -0.42  -0.42      .    . .       .

Legend:
 comparison - Treatment comparison
 k          - Number of studies providing direct evidence
 prop       - Direct evidence proportion
 nma        - Estimated treatment effect (SMD) in network meta-analysis
 direct     - Estimated treatment effect (SMD) derived from direct evidence
 indir.     - Estimated treatment effect (SMD) derived from indirect evidence
 Diff       - Difference between direct and indirect treatment estimates
 z          - z-value of test for disagreement (direct versus indirect)
 p-value    - p-value of test for disagreement (direct versus indirect)
[1] "Percent of comparisons where there is some evidence (p-value<0.05) of disagreement between direct and indirect sources: NaN. (0 out of 0 comparisons)."
