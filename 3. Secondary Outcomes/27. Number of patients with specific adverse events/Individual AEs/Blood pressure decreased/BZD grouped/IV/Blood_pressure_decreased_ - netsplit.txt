Separate indirect from direct evidence (SIDE) using back-calculation method

Fixed effects model: 

       comparison k prop  nma direct indir. RoR z p-value
 placebo:zolpidem 1 1.00 0.19   0.19      .   . .       .

Random effects model: 

       comparison k prop  nma direct indir. RoR z p-value
 placebo:zolpidem 1 1.00 0.19   0.19      .   . .       .

Legend:
 comparison - Treatment comparison
 k          - Number of studies providing direct evidence
 prop       - Direct evidence proportion
 nma        - Estimated treatment effect (OR) in network meta-analysis
 direct     - Estimated treatment effect (OR) derived from direct evidence
 indir.     - Estimated treatment effect (OR) derived from indirect evidence
 RoR        - Ratio of Ratios (direct versus indirect)
 z          - z-value of test for disagreement (direct versus indirect)
 p-value    - p-value of test for disagreement (direct versus indirect)
[1] "Percent of comparisons where there is some evidence (p-value<0.05) of disagreement between direct and indirect sources: NaN. (0 out of 0 comparisons)."
